              <p class="card-text mt-5">Shim and his team were friendly and
                punctual. They arrived on time everyday
                and completed the work they
                highlighted. The entire house refurb was
                completed in 4 weeks including new
                electrics, plumbing, plastering/
                decorating, new flooring and carpentry
                work. I am very pleased with the work
                which was reasonably priced and highly
                recommend these guys for anyone
                looking for a house refurb.</p>

                  removed and new base laid in a day, with the entire new composite decking completed the next day with

                <p class="card-text mt-5">We used Bexcrest Homes for upgrading our kitchen worktops. They arrived on
                  time, reconfirmed all the crucial measurements and were able to complete the worktops ahead of
                  schedule. Their rapport prior to, during and after the project was completed was excellent. The
                  pricing was agreed beforehand and I found this to be very competitive. I would seek Bexcrest services
                  again for any of my domestic repair/refurbishment needs and would recommend them.</p>
